# base
This is a simple base setup using Docker Compose to host an Nginx reverse proxy
microservice, and both an 'api' and a 'client' directories with some placeholder
files.
It also features a very basic GitHub pipeline for pushing changes to my VPS, and
a bash file with some basic helper commands.
